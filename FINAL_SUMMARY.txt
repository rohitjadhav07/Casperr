================================================================================

PROBLEM: $100+ billion lost annually to corruption in welfare/NGO funding

SOLUTION: Blockchain-based escrow with community governance

MECHANISM: "No proof, no vote, no funds"
   1. Donor funds project → CSPR locked
   2. NGO completes work → Submits proof
   3. Community reviews → Votes on-chain
   4. Smart contract → Releases funds automatically

IMPACT: Makes corruption impossible, not just illegal
