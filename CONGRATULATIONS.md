## 🎬 The Story You Can Tell

### The Problem
"Billions of dollars in welfare funds and NGO grants are lost to corruption every year. Current systems lack transparency and accountability."

### Your Solution
"I built CivicTrust, a blockchain-based platform that makes corruption impossible. Funds are locked in smart contracts and released only after community-verified proof of milestone completion."

### The Impact
"This addresses a $100+ billion problem and can help millions of people receive the aid they deserve. It's not just a hackathon project - it's infrastructure for a more transparent world."

### The Technology
"Built on Casper Network with Rust smart contracts, featuring milestone-based escrow, community governance, reputation NFTs, and liquid staking integration."

### The Future
"After the hackathon, I plan to run pilot programs with NGOs, secure grant funding, and scale to production. The goal is to make CivicTrust the global standard for transparent fund distribution."
