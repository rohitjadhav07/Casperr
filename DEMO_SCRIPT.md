## Script

### Opening (10 seconds)

**[Show homepage]**

"Hi, I'm [name] and this is CivicTrust - a platform that makes corruption in NGO funding impossible."

"The problem: billions in welfare funds are lost to corruption every year. The solution: blockchain-based accountability."

---

### Act 1: Create Project (30 seconds)

**[Click "Create Project"]**

"Let me show you how it works. I'm a donor who wants to fund a school building project."

**[Fill form while talking]**
- Project name: "School Building Project"
- Beneficiary: [paste address]
- Amount: 10,000 CSPR
- Milestone 1: "Foundation Complete" - 50%
- Milestone 2: "Building Complete" - 50%

"I'm funding 10,000 CSPR, split into two milestones. The NGO only gets paid when they prove completion."

**[Click "Create & Fund Project"]**

"Funds are now locked in a smart contract. No one can touch them without community approval."

**[Show transaction in explorer]**

"Here's the transaction on Casper testnet - fully transparent and verifiable."

---

### Act 2: Submit Proof (25 seconds)

**[Navigate to project detail]**

"Now let's say the NGO completed the foundation. They need to submit proof."

**[Switch to beneficiary account]**

"As the NGO, I upload photos and documents to IPFS..."

**[Paste IPFS hash]**

"...and submit the hash on-chain."

**[Click "Submit Proof"]**

"This opens a 7-day voting period for the community to verify."

**[Show transaction in explorer]**

"Again, everything is on-chain and transparent."

---

### Act 3: Community Voting (25 seconds)

**[Switch to voter account 1]**

"Now community members can review the proof and vote."

**[Show IPFS proof - optional if time]**

"They can check the actual proof on IPFS."

**[Click "Vote Yes"]**

"This voter approves."

**[Switch to voter account 2]**

**[Click "Vote Yes"]**

"Another voter approves."

**[Show vote counts updating]**

"Vote counts update in real-time. We need 3 votes minimum."

**[Switch to voter account 3]**

**[Click "Vote Yes"]**

"Third vote is in."

---

### Act 4: Fund Release (20 seconds)

**[Click "Finalize Milestone"]**

"Once voting passes, anyone can trigger the fund release."

**[Show transaction processing]**

"The smart contract automatically transfers 5,000 CSPR to the NGO."

**[Show updated balances]**

"50% released. The process repeats for the next milestone."

**[Show transaction in explorer]**

"All verifiable on-chain."

---

### Closing (10 seconds)

"That's CivicTrust: No proof, no vote, no funds."

## Common Questions & Answers

**Q: What if the community votes no?**
A: Funds stay locked. The NGO can submit new proof or the donor can cancel the project.

**Q: How do you prevent fake voters?**
A: Reputation NFTs track voting history. Future versions will use weighted voting.

**Q: What about privacy?**
A: Only proof hashes are on-chain. Sensitive data stays off-chain.

**Q: Can this scale?**
A: Yes - we're using efficient data structures and planning Layer 2 integration.

**Q: Why Casper?**
A: Casper's governance features, liquid staking, and enterprise focus are perfect for this use case.
